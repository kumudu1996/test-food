# Delivery Module

This folder contains the **delivery boy** application separated from the main apps.

Structure:
- `backend/`: lightweight API for delivery login, order status updates, and live location updates
- `frontend/`: delivery boy UI (login + delivery dashboard)

Both are designed to work with the existing MongoDB database used by `foodiesapi`.
